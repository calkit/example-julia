# Calkit Julia example

This project demonstrates how to use Julia with
[Calkit](https://github.com/calkit/calkit).

To run the pipeline, which currently simulates flow around a cylinder with
[WaterLily.jl](https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily.jl)
and compiles figures as part of a LaTeX document, execute:

```sh
calkit run
```
